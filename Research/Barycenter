# Barycenter

The barycenter is the center of mass of two or more bodies that orbit one another and is the point about which the bodies orbit.
If one of the two orbiting bodies is much more massive than the other and the bodies are relatively close to one another, 
the barycenter will typically be located within the more massive object. This is the case for the Earth–Moon system, 
in which the barycenter is located on average 4,671 km (2,902 mi) from Earth's center, 75% of Earth's radius of 6,378 km (3,963 mi).
