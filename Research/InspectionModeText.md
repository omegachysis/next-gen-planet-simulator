## Greenhouse effect 
Greenhouse effect, a warming of Earth's surface and troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere) 
caused by the presence of water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and certain other gases in the air.
Of those gases, known as greenhouse gases, water vapor has the largest effect.
## Aerosols 
There are some aerosols that cause cooling while others cause warming. 
Aerosols come from volcanoes, dust storms, fires, vegetation, sea spray, burning of fossil fuels and land use. 
Warming aerosols include black carbon and dark soot. Cooling aerosols include dust, sulfate particles and sea spray.
## Acid Rain
Acid rain is caused by a chemical reaction that begins when compounds like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides 
are released into the air. These substances can rise very high into the atmosphere, where they mix and 
react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form more acidic pollutants, known as acid rain.
## Volcanoes
Volcanoes erupt because of density and pressure. The lower density of the magma relative to the 
surrounding rocks causes it to rise (like air bubbles in syrup). It will rise to the surface or to 
a depth that is determined by the density of the magma and the weight of the rocks above it.
## Craters
Craters come in two flavors: those that arenâ€™t caused by asteroids or comets, impact craters, 
are formed by powerful volcanic explosions. Such outburst can be violent enough that once the eruption is over, 
the volcano collapses in on its empty vacant magma chamber and forms a caldera, or volcanic crater.
## Van Allen Belt
A Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles, most of which originate from the solar wind, 
that are captured by and held around a planet by that planet's magnetic field. Earth has two such belts and 
sometimes others may be temporarily created.
## Thermodynamics
Atmospheric thermodynamics describes the effect of buoyant forces that cause the rise of less dense (warmer) air, 
the descent of more dense air, and the transformation of water from liquid to vapor (evaporation) and its condensation.
