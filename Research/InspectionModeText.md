## Greenhouse Effect 
Greenhouse effect, a warming of Earth's surface and troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere) 
caused by the presence of water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and certain other gases in the air.
Of those gases, known as greenhouse gases, water vapor has the largest effect.
## Aerosols 
There are some aerosols that cause cooling while others cause warming. 
Aerosols come from volcanoes, dust storms, fires, vegetation, sea spray, burning of fossil fuels and land use. 
Warming aerosols include black carbon and dark soot. Cooling aerosols include dust, sulfate particles and sea spray.
## Acid Rain
Acid rain is caused by a chemical reaction that begins when compounds like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides 
are released into the air. These substances can rise very high into the atmosphere, where they mix and 
react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form more acidic pollutants, known as acid rain.
## Volcanoes
Volcanoes erupt because of density and pressure. The lower density of the magma relative to the 
surrounding rocks causes it to rise (like air bubbles in syrup). It will rise to the surface or to 
a depth that is determined by the density of the magma and the weight of the rocks above it.
## Craters
Craters come in two flavors: those that aren’t caused by asteroids or comets, impact craters, 
are formed by powerful volcanic explosions. Such outburst can be violent enough that once the eruption is over, 
the volcano collapses in on its empty vacant magma chamber and forms a caldera, or volcanic crater.
## Van Allen Belt
A Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles, most of which originate from the solar wind, 
that are captured by and held around a planet by that planet's magnetic field. Earth has two such belts and 
sometimes others may be temporarily created.
## Thermodynamics
Atmospheric thermodynamics describes the effect of buoyant forces that cause the rise of less dense (warmer) air, 
the descent of more dense air, and the transformation of water from liquid to vapor (evaporation) and its condensation.
## Solar Wind
The solar wind is a stream of energized, charged particles, primarily electrons and protons, flowing outward from the Sun. It is made of plasma. The solar wind is what blows the tails of comets back away from the bodies of comets. It affects it by the intense clouds of high energy particles that it often contains which are produced by solar storms. When these clouds, called coronal mass ejections, make their way to the Earth in 3-4 days, they collide with the magnetic field of the Earth and cause it to change its shape.
## Cosmic Rays
Cosmic rays are high-energy protons and atomic nuclei which move through space at nearly the speed of light. The cosmic rays control the electrical system of the atmosphere which in turn affects cloud microphysics and radiative transfer of the atmosphere. Both clouds and radiative transfer change the global temperature and thus affect climate change.
## Meteorite Impacts 
Meteorite impacts happen when rocks from space crash into Earth's surface. A meteorite impacts
can leave behind a crater, a large hollow area in the ground. Most meteorites burn as they reach the earth's atmosphere. The fall of meteorites or asteroids in the earth's oceans has the potential of generating tsunamis of cataclysmic proportions.
## Space Radiation
Space radiation is made up of three kinds of radiation: particles trapped in the Earth’s magnetic field; particles shot into space during solar flares; and galactic cosmic rays. Space radiation is dangerous and one of the primary health risks for astronauts. Radiation can alter the cardiovascular system, damaging the heart, harden and narrow arteries, and eliminate some of the cells in linings of the blood vessels, leading to cardiovascular disease.
