# Stellar Model Discription
## Red Giant
Once all of the hydrogen in the star’s core is converted to helium, the core collapses on itself, c
ausing the star to expand. As it expands, it first becomes a sub-giant star, then a red giant. 
A red giant is a luminous giant star of low or intermediate mass (roughly 0.3–8 solar masses) 
in a late phase of stellar evolution. The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous, making the radius 
large and the surface temperature around 5,000 K (4,700 °C; 8,500 °F) or lower.

## Black Holes
Black holes formed by the collapse of individual stars are relatively small, but incredibly dense. 
One of these objects’ packs more than three times the mass of the sun into the diameter of a city. 
This leads to a crazy amount of gravitational force pulling on objects around the object. Stellar black 
holes then consume the dust and gas from their surrounding galaxies, which keeps them growing in size.

## White Dwarf
A white dwarf is a small, very dense, hot star that is made mostly of carbon. If a white dwarf is close 
enough to a companion star, its gravity may drag matter - mostly hydrogen - from the outer layers of that 
star onto itself, building up its surface layer. When enough hydrogen has accumulated on the surface, a burst 
of nuclear fusion occurs, causing the white dwarf to brighten substantially and expel the remaining material.

## Neutron Star
A neutron star is a very small, super-dense star which is composed mostly of tightly-packed neutrons. It has a 
thin atmosphere of hydrogen. It has a diameter of about 5-10 miles (5-16 km) and a density of roughly 10 15 gm/cm3. 
Neutron stars also have powerful magnetic fields which can accelerate atomic particles around its magnetic poles 
producing powerful beams of radiation. Those beams sweep around like massive searchlight beams as the star rotates. 
If such a beam is oriented so that it periodically points toward the Earth, we observe it as regular pulses of
radiation that occur whenever the magnetic pole sweeps past the line of sight. In this case, the neutron star is 
known as a pulsar.

## Yellow Dwarf
A G-type main-sequence star (Spectral type: G-V), often called a yellow dwarf, or G dwarf star, is a main-sequence 
star of spectral type G. Such a star has about 0.84 to 1.15 solar masses and surface temperature of between 5,300 
and 6,000 K. The phrase “yellow dwarf” isn’t quite right, because not all yellow dwarf stars are yellow. Some are 
white. Our sun is one of these; it is actually white. People perceive it as yellow because we view 
it through our atmosphere, which distorts its color.

## Blue Giant and Blue Supergiant Stars
Blue supergiant stars are among the brightest, hottest, and most massive stars in the universe. Blue Giants 
are about 172 times hotter than the Earth, but still quite cool compared to blue supergiant. These stars are 
some of the hottest and can have surface temperatures in excess of 40,000K – about four times hotter than the Sun. 
It’s also the most massive star, with an estimated mass of over 250 Suns and a volume large enough to contain 
27,000 Suns within it. These stars don’t live long. These stars survive by fusing hydrogen into helium. The more 
massive the star, the quicker it burns through its supply of hydrogen and, therefore, the shorter its lifespan.
